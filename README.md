it prints the moves of the disks to the screen.
# the output on the console was like this
if we want to print the moves on the screen
In fact, I made plays on some parts of the code that I added to the top to solve the problem.My goal was to make the computer do it in the background and print the times instead of printing the process for a long time every time.13.i entered the number of disks information by adding a for loop to the line.Time and 19.since I also included printf in the line, I printed every move correctly.You can see the table below. My goal was to show up to 40 moves, but my computer didn't hold up.i later changed it to 37 in the code above.

In fact, when we look at the output of the elapsed times in this table, we conclude that it goes in the form of 2n.
